ISE 247 â€“ Logistics for Supply Chain

Class Project

Students need to conduct an applied logistics project that involves writing the Python programs to solve the Network Design Problems and Facility Design Problems. The project is expected to be completed by a team consisting of two students. The instructor provides a candidate topic and data sets. The students are encouraged to propose the topics on their own. By doing so, the students are responsible to discuss the topics with the instructor before the Midterm and get permission.

Tasks

Task 1 (50 points): Network design with demand divisibility

Task 2 (50 points): Quadratic assignment for facility design with departments of same area

The primary goal of the project is to utilize the modeling and software skills learned from the class to solve complex logistics problems You should demonstrate your capacity of using programming language to read and manipulate text files and formulate logistic problems appropriately to an optimization solver to obtain an optimal solution.
One small sample and a set of large-sized instances for the first task have been uploaded to Canvas. The data sets for the second task will be uploaded later.

Deliveries

The project is due in the lecture of May 14. The deliveries include a project report (a hard copy and an electronic copy), a class presentation, and Python source codes with comments and explanation so your instructor can read and understand it. Your instructor must be able to run Python programs automatically for a given instance.
The project report needs to include the following necessary contents.

1: problem statement and formulation
Note that you should use math notations to write the formulation. For example, using n to denote the number of departments. Review the class slides for more details.

2: program design
Here are some sample questions: What functionalities do your programs need to complete? How do you design your program? Any function used? How do you get the input data?

3: computational results
You need to design a table to report the computational results. For example, Instance_name, objective_value, is_optimal
